# Validation Report for TICKET-101

## What Was Good
- The code is well-organized into groups, like controllers and services, which makes it easy to understand.
- Constants are used for important numbers like loan amounts and periods. This avoids confusion and makes changes simpler.
- Different specific errors are used for different problems, which helps quickly find and explain issues.
- The code has helpful comments and JavaDoc, making it easier to read and understand.

## Things to Improve

- I would change the names of some packages and classes to better reflect what they do. Also, I think either the Decision or DecisionResponse class is not needed because they do the same thing.
- The `getCreditModifier` method uses fixed ranges to determine segments, which could be made more flexible.
- The `DecisionEngine` class handles input checks, business rules, and ID code reading all in one place. It would be clearer if these tasks were in separate classes.
- The loop in `calculateApprovedLoan` that increases the loan period to find a suitable loan amount might not work well if the starting conditions are not nearly right.

## Most Important Shortcoming

**Issue:** The scoring algorithm was missing, and using a loop to gradually check each loan period for a suitable loan amount could lead to slow performance.

**Fix:** I added a simple scoring calculation and a more direct method to figure out the shortest needed period, which avoids unnecessary checks.
